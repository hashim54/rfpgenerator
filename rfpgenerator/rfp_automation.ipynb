    "LLMs have unlocked use cases in almost every industry due to the wide range of tasks they are capable of performing. In the **Professional Services / Consulting** industry, LLMs are being leveraged for two main use cases:\n",

    "2. LLM apps to automate the generation of Request For Proposal (RFP) responses as well as other deliverable that the consultants deliver on a daily basis.\n",

    "LLMs including GPT 4 are NLG models and have been shown tremendous capability at high quality content generation. In the case of generating content for an RFP response, an LLM will need to generate customized content specific to the consulting firm responding to the RFP response. In particular, the consulting firm's expertise in the industry of the RFP requestor needs to be captured in the LLM generated RFP response along with previous experience in similar deliveries to other clients and other details that distinguish the firm responding to the RFP request. This means that relevant context needs to be provided to the LLM for a specific and high quality response to be generated. \n",
    "The RFP response process as implemented in this notebook can be broken down into the following steps: \n",
    "1. Review the RFP request and extract the output format, evaluation criteria, specific questions that need to be answered and any other requirements needed for the RFP response.\n",
    "2. Based on the RFP context extracted in step 1, generate 15-20 questions that must be answered in the RFP response for demonstrating the responding firm's expertise in the services requested in the RFP. \n",
    "3. Implement Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and use the internal knowledge base of the consulting firm to retrieve relevant expertise of the consulting firm in the services requested in the RFP. For the purposes of this PoC, due to the absence of a proper knowledge base, Bing Search API was used to retrieve relevant data from the internet and aid in the implementation of RAG. "
